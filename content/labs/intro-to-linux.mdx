  # Introduction to Linux


  Welcome to the Linux command line! In this lab, you will learn how to navigate
  the filesystem and interact with files.


  ## Step 1: Navigation


  Open your terminal. You are currently in your home directory. To see where you
  are, type:


  ```bash

  pwd

  ```


  To list the files in the current directory, type:


  ```bash

  ls

  ```


  ## Step 2: Reading Files


  There is a file named welcome.txt. To read it, use the cat command:


  ```bash

  cat welcome.txt

  ```


  ### Step 3: Finding the Flag


  Navigate to the documents directory:


  ```bash

  cd documents

  ```


  List the files again. You should see a file named `secret.txt`. Read the
  contents of `secret.txt` to find the flag.


  Enter the flag in the submission box below.
