  # Hidden File Hunt


  A flag has been hidden in a file somewhere inside the
  `/home/student/challenge` directory. The file might be hidden (starting with a
  dot) or just buried deep in subdirectories.


  Your mission is to find the file and read its content.


  ## Hints


  * `ls -a` shows hidden files.

  * `find . -name "*flag*"` might be useful.
