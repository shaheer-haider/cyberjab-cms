  # Network Reconnaissance Basics


  In this lab, you will learn how to discover active hosts and open ports on a
  network.


  ## Step 1: Connectivity Check with Ping


  The target machine is located at `10.0.0.5`. First, verify that the target is
  reachable using ping:


  ```bash

  ping -c 4 10.0.0.5

  ```


  You should see responses indicating the host is up.


  ## Step 2: Port Scanning with Nmap


  Now we want to see what services are running on the target. We will use nmap
  (Network Mapper). Run a basic scan against the target:


  ```bash

  nmap 10.0.0.5

  ```


  Analyze the output. Which port is listed as open and running HTTP? Enter the
  port number as the flag (e.g., if port 22 is open, enter 22).

  Solution

  Run `ping -c 4 10.0.0.5` to verify connectivity.

  Run `nmap 10.0.0.5`.

  The output will show port 80/tcp is open.

  The flag is **80**.
